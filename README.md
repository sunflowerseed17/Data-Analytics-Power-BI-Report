## What is the project?
The project runs through the Data Analysis process of multiple tables, connections, cleaning, analysing and visualising the data within the dataset. This is done using PowerBI, as a means of learning the steps and the functions of the program. 

## Steps followed
1) Created a new .pbix file for the project
2) Imported tables using 4 different methodologies:
- The Orders table was imported using an Azure SQL Database
- The Products table was imported from a locally sourced .csv
- The Stores table was imported using Azure Blob Storage
- The Customers table was imported using the Combine and Transform function from three separate .csv files within a folder, which appended them into one
4) Cleaned and renamed the columns in each of the tables
